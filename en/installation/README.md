# Installation

## Starting a New Project

The best way to start a *project* is to base it on a already available project *distribution*. There are distributions for general web projects or for projects that require a micro-framework style approach.
Distributions come with a predefined app [file structure](./architecture/file-structure.md), some boilerplate code and the bundled core library.

We'll base our new project off the officially supported [framework distribution](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/framework).

### Using Composer

<div class="note note-version">This feature will become available with 1.1.0</div>

For the start we'll use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to create our project in
the current directory as `project`.

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist unionofrad/framework project
```

### Using Git

Don't want to use composer? No problem, you can also just use plain Git, too. The following command
will clone the distribution into the current directory as `project`. The upstream's repository
will be setup with the name `distro`.

```bash
git clone --origin distro https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/framework.git project
```

We'll than switch into that directory and initialize the submodules of that repository.
Submodules are used in order to have no dependencies other than on the core library itself.

```bash
cd project
git submodule update --init
```

If everything worked as expected, you should now have the lithium core inside `project/libraries/lithium`.

## Pedal to the Metal

For the purposes of this guide, we'll be using PHP's builtin development webserver. This is good for development purposes but should of course not be used in production. Instructions on how to use other
webservers are described at the end of this guide.

### Permissions

The framework will need write access to the `app/resources/tmp` as it used to store cached versions of
already compiled templates or logs. The webserver you use must be able to write to this directory.

### Starting the Webserver

Make sure you are in the root of the project. Now start PHP's builtin webserver using the following command. Your project is then being served at 127.0.0.1 on port 8080.

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t app/webroot index.php
```

Finally, pull up the project in your browser and visit [`http://127.0.0.1:8080`](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
At this point, you should be presented with the default home page. **You're up and running!**

## Livin' on the Edge

The methods described in the previous sections will download the most recent tagged version of
the framework and core library. In some cases, it may be desirable to update both to the very
latest available revision, which may not have been tagged yet.

### Using Composer

<div class="note note-version">This feature will become available with 1.1.0</div>

```bash
composer create-project -s dev unionofrad/framework project

cd project
git checkout dev

cd libraries/lithium
git checkout dev
```

### Using Git

```bash
git clone --origin distro https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/framework.git project

cd project
git checkout dev

cd libraries/lithium
git checkout dev
git pull
```
